will be store the purpose of the transaction. If "comment-to" is present
this comment will be recorded locally to store the recipient of the
transaction.`,

considered. "comment" if present is recorded locally as the purpose of the
transaction.`,

returned if successful.`,

Sets the account associated with "address" to "account".`,

	"setgenerate": `setgenerate generate ( genproclimit )
Sets the current mining state to "generate". Up to "genproclimit" processors
will be used, if genproclimit is -1 then it is unlimited.`,

	"settxfee": `settxfee amount
Sets the current transaction fee.`,

	"signmessage": `signmessage "address" "message"
Returns a signature for "message" with the private key of "address"`,

Signs the inputs for the serialized and hex encoded transaction in
"hexstring".  "prevtxs" optionally is an is an array of objects
representing the previous tx outputs that are spent here but may not yet
be in the blockchain, it takes the following format:
[

If the third argument is provided these base58-encoded private keys in
the list will be the only keys used to sign the transaction. sighashtype
optionally denoes the signature hash type to be used. is must be one of the
following:
	"ALL",
	"NONE",
	"SINGLE",

Will attempt to submit the block serialized in "data" to the bitcoin network.
optionalparametersobject takes the following format:
{
	"workid":"id"	# If getblocktemplate provided a workid it must be included with submissions.
}`,

	"validateaddress": `validateaddress "address
Returns a JSON objects containing information about the provided "address".
Format:
{

	"verifychain": `verifychain ( checklevel=3 numblocks=288 )
Verifies the stored blockchain database. "checklevel" denotes how thorough the
check is and "numblocks" how many blocks from the tip will be verified.`,

	"verifymessage": `verifymessage "bitcoinaddress" "signature" "message"
Verifies the signature "signature" for "message" from the key related
to "bitcoinaddress". The return is true or false if the signature
verified correctly.`,

	"walletlock": `walletlock
Removes any encryption key for the wallet from memory, unlocking the wallet.
In order to use wallet functionality again the wallet must be unlocked via
walletpassphrase.`,

	"walletpassphrase": `walletpassphrase "passphrase" timeout
